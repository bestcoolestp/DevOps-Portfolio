# AWS SAA Learning Logs

Notes from my AWS Solutions Architect Associate study since **2025-11-23**.
Goal: build SAA knowledge with an operator’s mindset (tradeoffs, failure modes, security).

## How these logs are structured
Each entry includes:
- key takeaways
- exam traps
- micro-scenarios (how I’d answer)
- hands-on proof or lab follow-up
