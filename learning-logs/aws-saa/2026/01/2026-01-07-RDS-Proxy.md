# 2026-01-07 — Amazon RDS Proxy

**Source:** Stephane Maarek — AWS SAA  
**Theme:** connection pooling and resilient database access

> “Too many connections don’t scale databases — they break them.”

## Core Concept
**Amazon RDS Proxy** is a fully managed, serverless database proxy for RDS and Aurora.

- Sits between application and database.
- Pools and reuses connections.
- Multi-AZ and highly available.
- Accessible **only inside the VPC** (never public).

---

## Why it matters

### Connection pooling
- Reduces direct DB connections.
- Reuses existing connections efficiently.
- Lowers CPU and memory pressure on the database.

### Faster failover
- Can reduce failover time by **up to ~66%**.
- Applications reconnect faster during RDS/Aurora failover events.

### Security integration
- Supports **IAM authentication**.
- Works with **AWS Secrets Manager** for credentials.
- Centralizes access control.

## Key characteristics
- Serverless and auto-scaling.
- No capacity planning required.
- Minimal or no application code changes.
- App connects to proxy endpoint instead of DB endpoint.

**Supported engines**
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB
- Microsoft SQL Server
- Aurora (MySQL & PostgreSQL)

## Important use case: AWS Lambda

Problem:
- Lambda can scale to thousands of concurrent executions.
- Direct DB connections can overwhelm RDS.

Solution:
- RDS Proxy pools connections.
- Prevents connection storms.
- Improves stability for serverless workloads.

---

## Exam signals
Think **RDS Proxy** when you see:
- too many DB connections
- Lambda overwhelming RDS
- need for connection pooling
- IAM authentication at DB layer
- faster failover requirement

---

## My takeaway
RDS Proxy is less about performance tuning and more about **connection discipline**.
It protects databases from bursty clients (especially Lambda) while improving failover behavior and centralizing authentication.
